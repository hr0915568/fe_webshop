         <h3>4. INSPECTION:</h3>
            <p>Seller's facilities, equipment, materials, records, and the Products and Services purchased and to be purchased under this Order are subject to Buyer's audit, inspection, and acceptance. Seller and all subcontractors of Seller agree that Buyer may inspect any Products during any stage of their manufacture, construction, preparation, delivery or completion. Buyer and Buyer’s customers (including automobile manufacturers also referred to as Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEM") and other suppliers to the OEM (collectively “Buyer’s Customers”) have the right to enter onto Seller’s or Seller’s subcontractors' premises at reasonable times to inspect the facility, supplies, materials and any of the Buyer’s property covered by this Order. Seller agrees to provide any and all reasonable or pertinent supporting documentation required by Buyer or Buyer’s Customers in the course of such investigation. The method of inspection may be by selective, random or 100% sampling, at the sole discretion of Buyer. At Buyer's request, Seller and Seller’s subcontractors shall submit production and quality test reports and related data. All costs associated with this Section 4 are the responsibility of Seller. Buyer’s inspection of the Products, whether during manufacture, prior to delivery or within a reasonable time after delivery, shall not constitute acceptance of any work-in-process or finished Products. Payment for the Products shipped and Services performed shall not constitute acceptance. Products and Services shall only be deemed accepted when they have actually been counted, inspected, and tested by Buyer and found to be in conformance with this Order. Nothing in this Order shall relieve Seller from the obligation of testing, inspection and quality control. Seller and all subcontractors of Seller also agree to provide Buyer access to all pertinent information, including but not limited to, books, records, payroll data, receipts, correspondence and other documents and materials in the possession or under the control of Seller, or otherwise relating to any of Seller’s obligations under this Order or any payments requested by Seller pursuant to this Order. Buyer will have the right at any reasonable time to send its authorized representatives to examine all such information.

Seller and all subcontractors of Seller shall adhere to all quality, testing, development, and production approval programs and processes of Buyer and Buyer’s Customers on an ongoing basis, with the objective of delivering zero defects for all Products. Seller acknowledges that Buyer supplies parts to Buyer’s Customers and that Buyer may be required to participate in the warranty share programs of each OEM that is Buyer’s Customer (‘WSP”). Seller agrees that, by producing and supplying the Products associated with this Order, Seller will participate in WSP and will indemnify and hold Buyer harmless for any costs or losses allocated to Buyer pursuant to a WSP which are attributable, in whole or in part, to the Products supplied by Seller pursuant to this Order. Seller’s WSP indemnification obligations set forth in this paragraph shall apply regardless of any contradictory or competing term or condition contained in any communication by Seller to Buyer, or elsewhere in these Terms, or any purported disclaimer by the Seller of its participation in any WSP, which is hereby expressly rejected. Upon Buyer’s OEM Customer’s having allocated to Buyer costs that are attributable or allocable, in whole or in part under the terms and definitions of the WSP, to a Product supplied by Seller, Seller agrees that Buyer is entitled to immediately deduct such attributed or allocated cost and amount from any payment due or to become due to Seller from Buyer. In the event Buyer has no payment obligation or balance owed to Seller against which to deduct such cost, Buyer shall invoice Seller for the cost assessed against Buyer pursuant to the terms of any WSP, which invoice shall be paid in full by Seller within ten (10) days after Buyer has supplied to the Seller documentation confirming the costs allocated to Buyer pursuant to Buyer’s Customer’s WSP. Seller shall indemnify Buyer for all costs and expenses incurred by Buyer that are reasonably or equitably related to, attributable to, or allocable, in whole or in part pursuant to a WSP, to a part or tool supplied by Seller to Buyer pursuant to this Order. In the event that the costs allocated by Buyer’s OEM Customer to Buyer pursuant to the terms of an applicable WSP are not specifically allocated to each component or part within a system, Buyer shall have the right to allocate to Seller, in good faith and based on available information, an equitable and reasonable share of that WSP cost allocation attributed to the Buyer based on the incorporation of Seller’s Product into the component or system against which the OEM WSP allocation is made.</p>
         <p>Any failure to fully comply with any of these provisions shall constitute a material breach of Seller’s obligations under this Order. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is Seller’s obligation to ensure that appropriate testing, inspection, conformity and quality control is performed on the Products and Services and nothing in this Order shall relieve Seller of that obligation. All completed Products shall be packaged and labeled in accordance with Buyer’s requirements. All Products shall permanently bear Buyer's part number and name or code name, including any applicable bar coding identification, Seller's part number, and Seller’s date of manufacture, unless otherwise agreed by Buyer in writing. Seller will supply samples in accordance with the applicable quality standards as set forth above as requested by Buyer. In addition to the foregoing, Seller must comply with the provisions and meet all standards imposed by ISO/TS 16949:2002, unless Buyer informs Seller in writing that it need not do so and instructs Seller to comply with a different standard, in which case such alternate standard shall be applicable in addition to all other applicable standards and requirements. Seller shall, if requested by Buyer, furnish a certificate indicating compliance with all applicable standards.</p>

            other order, contract, agreement or obligation involving BUYER<br />

         <p>foregoing, Buyer’s obligation to make payments to Seller for Products and Services purchased pursuant to this Order are conditioned upon Buyer’s receipt of payment with respect to such Products from any applicable Buyer’s Customer. To the extent that Seller does not invoice Buyer with respect to any Products which are purchased pursuant to this Order within one (1) year of Seller’s delivery of such Products, Buyer shall have no obligation to pay Seller for such Products. Any claims of Seller with respect to payment by Buyer for Products or Services under this Order must be submitted to Buyer in writing within one (1) year of the date on which the Products are received by Seller or the Services are completed or be deemed waived and Seller shall be estopped from pursuing all such claims. Any legal action against Buyer for payment must be commenced within one (1) year of the date on which payment was due or be forever barred.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
         <p>Notwithstanding payment or prior inspection and in addition to all other remedies it may have, Buyer, at its option and at Seller's sole risk and expense, may reject and return or retain and correct, Products that fail to conform to any warranty, specification, standard, or other requirement of this Order, even if the non-conformity does not become apparent until the manufacturing or processing stage and whether or not such non-conforming Products constitute raw materials being manufactured or processed by Buyer or Buyer’s customers or Products manufactured or processed by Seller from prototypes provided by Buyer or Buyer’s customers. If requested by Buyer, Seller promptly will evaluate the Products to determine the root cause of the non-conformance and provide Buyer with an analysis of the non-conforming Products and Seller's plan to correct the non-conformance in the Products at issue and those shipped in the future.

Title to Products designated for return by Buyer will immediately revert to Seller upon notice to Seller of Buyer's intent to return the Products.

         <p>10.

If Buyer, in its sole discretion, does not consider either of the foregoing alternatives to be acceptable, Buyer may return all or any part of the Products for a full refund of the total amounts paid for the affected Products and assert all other remedies available to Buyer under this Order or under controlling law. Seller will not enter into any settlement order that affects any Indemnified Parties without Buyer’s prior written consent.

If a stop work order has a material effect on cost of delivery, an equitable adjustment shall be made in the Price (excluding profit) or the delivery schedule or both, provided however, that no adjustment in Price or delivery shall be made under this provision (i) if the work would have been otherwise interrupted or delayed or (ii) for which an adjustment is available or excluded under any other provision of this Order. No claim for adjustment shall be allowed unless submitted to Buyer in writing (setting forth the proposed adjustment amount) within twenty (20) days after the work is terminated or the stop work order expires or is canceled, whichever first occurs.</p>

         <p>36. DISPUTES; GOVERNING LAW; LIMITATIONS PERIOD: This Order shall be considered as a contract made and to be performed in the State of Michigan and the United States of America. The parties agree that this Order, all transactions and conduct related to this Order, and all disputes and causes of action between the parties related thereto (in contract, warranty, tort, strict liability, by statute, regulation or otherwise) shall be governed exclusively by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan and the United States of America, without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions, and any conflict of law provisions that would require application of another choice of law. The parties specifically disclaim application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Subject to the other provisions of this paragraph, prior to the enforcement of any remedies under this Order, the parties must attempt to resolve their disputes through good faith negotiations and, if those negotiations fail, through a formal mediation moderated by a neutral third party. Any such mediation will be held in Michigan and the parties will share the cost of the mediation equally. The mediation shall occur within 45 days of the delivery of written notice requesting mediation. If the dispute is not resolved after mediation, then, at Buyer’s sole option and discretion exercised by written notice to Seller delivered to Seller any time within 45 days after the mediation concludes, or within 30 days following the service of process in a legal action, Buyer may commence binding self-administered arbitration including, without limitation, any claims or disputes related to this Order or any Product, whether based on contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory. The arbitration shall take place in Auburn Hills, Michigan consistent with the then-current CPR Rules for Non-Administered Arbitration. Three neutral arbitrators will conduct the self- administered arbitration, one selected by Buyer, one selected by Seller, and the third selected by the two arbitrators so selected. The arbitrators shall be selected no later than 45 days after the mediation concludes. There shall be appropriately limited discovery and the arbitrators will have the authority to award temporary and permanent injunctive relief, but may not award punitive or exemplary damages to either party. The written decision and award of the arbitrators, which shall include written findings of fact and conclusions of law, shall be issued no more than 30 days after arbitration concludes, and the award of the arbitrators will be enforceable, final and binding and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Buyer and Seller will each pay their own attorneys’ and consultants’ fees associated with the arbitration, and any other costs and expenses of the arbitration shall be allocated consistent with the applicable CPR Rules for Non-Administered Arbitration. The right to arbitrate under this section extends to any director, officer, employee, agent, or affiliate making or defending any claim which would otherwise be arbitrable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may, at its sole discretion and option, proceed directly to litigation. In the event of litigation, the parties agree that the sole and exclusive venue for all disputes, claims, or causes of action, whether legal or equitable, shall be in the state or federal courts within the geographic bounds of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, and Seller irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts and waives any and all rights to a jury trial. The arbitration provisions of this section shall be governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act. Seller agrees to fulfill its delivery and other obligations under this Order without interruption during the pendency of any dispute or legal action. Seller must formally initiate any legal action or claim against Buyer for an alleged breach of any obligation related to or arising out of this Order within one (1) year of the date of the alleged breach or be forever barred from pursuing such action or claim.</p>

      <p>of written notice requesting mediation. If the dispute is not resolved after mediation, then Buyer and Seller agree, that within no more than 120 days after mediation concludes, the sole means to resolve a claim or dispute shall be binding arbitration including without limitation those claims or disputes related to this Order or any Product, whether based on contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation, or other legal theory.

The arbitrators shall be selected no later than 30 days after the mediation concludes. The arbitration shall take place in Toronto, Ontario. The arbitrators will have the authority to award temporary and permanent injunctive relief, but may not award punitive or exemplary damages to either party. The decision and award of the arbitrators will be final and binding and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Buyer and Seller will pay their own attorneys’ fees associated with the arbitration, and will pay the other costs and expenses of the arbitration as the ADR Rules provide.

Seller must continue to fulfill its obligations under this Order without interruption during the pendency of any dispute or legal action. Seller must formally initiate any legal action or claim against Buyer for an alleged breach of any obligation related to or arising out of this Order within one (1) year of the date of the alleged breach or be forever barred from pursuing such action or claim.</p>
